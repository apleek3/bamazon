# Bamazon
## Overview
Command line app that uses npm inquirer and mySQL to create a storefront feeling for both pseudo "customers" and "managers."


## Setup
### To use this application yourself:
1) Set up a MySQL database on your machine. I used the 'community' version here: [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) 
2) Set up MySQL WorkBench: [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
3) Set up a new MySQL connection.
4) Create a new Data Base named: bamazon. 
5) Use the attached bamazon.sql to create a new table pre-loaded with information.
6) If you haven't already clone this repository to your computer
7) Using your terminal: cd to the root of the directory and install the node dependencies -- npm i --
8) Run the bamazonCustomer using node to "purchase" or check items available for sale from the bamazon database
9) Run the bamazonCustomer using node to add or change items in the inventory based on the available options.


### Notes about bamazonCustomer
Allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, department location, and price. You can "purchase" by entering the Item ID and Quantity. If there are enough in stock then then the order is "fulfilled" and the app displays the total purchase price and updates Database. If there is not enough in stock then the order must be modified.
